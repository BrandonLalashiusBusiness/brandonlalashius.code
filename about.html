        <h3 class="Afirst">
            My name is Brandon Lalashius, I am a graduate of a trade-school, Pathfinder Tech, in 2022! I graduated from the Electronics 
            Technology Trade, where I discovered my knack for programming (at first for Microcontrollers called Arduinos, then python)! 
            A little bit later after graduating, I started work on my first professional website! This site was the breakthrough I needed 
            to get into Web Development!
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="Asecond">Later on, I've started (and currently developing) a website for a friends company, where I 
            am learning more about Node JS server framework, MySQL Database, and even more JavaScript! My goals is to assist any and all 
            companies with their dynamic, professional, and incredible websites!
