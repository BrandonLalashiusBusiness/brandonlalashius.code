                    => This was my first professional website I've built! I had a lot of fun being able to work along side the Superintendent and 
                    commissioners, who assisted with designing the layout, and assisting me with update the page based on their requirements!

                    Wamazon => This site (an Amazon clone) is a full test (and is on my github!) which included JavaScript & MySQL database 
                    searching, HTML & CSS layout design, and even some graphic designing! This site has been the most learning I've done, which has 
                    assisted me with the next site, and even with some other personal projects!

                    P.R.A.M.A. => This work-in-progress website is for a friend's company, which is a car-flipping / dealership / car modification shop! 
                    This has been one of my most difficult professional pages designed so far, as I'm working with every head of the company, 
                    trying to design the page for optimal user experience (meaning learning UX design) and I am working on implement a 
                    full sign-in page with a database inventory editor, a part / vehicle search page. By far my most intensive website I've ever worked 
                    on (Most fun as well!)!
